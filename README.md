# Daily-Option-Writing

Selling options intraday on liquid underlyings like BABA, FB, AAPL, etc.

I've attempted to automate this strategy, but it is difficult to get options data and run checks for more than a few underlyings in a 
timely enough fashion.

main.py, operations.py, and tools.py are the system files.
